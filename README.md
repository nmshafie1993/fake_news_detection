# Fake News Detection with LSTM and Recurrent Neural Networks 

## Objective
In this project, I trained a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to detect fake news from a given news corpus. This project could be practically used by media companies such as twitter to automatically predict whether the current circulating news is fake or not.
